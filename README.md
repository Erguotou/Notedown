Notedown by Mod Monkeys [1]
===========================

Description
-----------

Notedown is a cross-platform open source notes editor. It is built with Eto.Forms[2], Mono[3] and the Tango Icon Library[4]. The Eto.Forms framework is an approach to make native-looking applications with Mono without having to know all the details about every single UI framework of all the platforms. The idea behind Notedown is to help fellow developers getting started with Mono cross-platform development by providing a well structured code base to explain the basic concepts behind the Eto.Forms framework.
